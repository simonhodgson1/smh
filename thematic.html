                    The inspiration and sources for my sculptural production are derived mainly from an interest in landscape and architecture. When we think about ‘landscape’ in terms of ‘humankinds’ purposeful intervention into the natural world, we think about landscaping and architectural constructions as well as pictorial constructions. Such interventions can be interpreted as a condition of a broader visualising culture, which includes such activity as cartography and clearing land for housing developments. Activities that are always limited; firstly by our physical capability for change and secondly by the boundaries of how we imagine ourselves. We can begin to analyse such endeavour (the need to change, adapt and inhabit ones environment) as a cultural longing for ‘identity’ and of connection with a ‘place’.  We collectively visualise how we might inhabit a place and configure the location and our imagination to fit. I’m interested in investigating sculpture within that broader visualising culture: and its role in ‘instituting a place’.<p></p>

                    Our relationship to a ‘place’ is a manifold of perception. Societies are formed around an individual’s perception of their environment, as well as, the way that person perceives and relates to others within that environment, each of whom relate to that environment on their own subjective level. It is from within this triangular structure that rituals of usage are developed and social behaviour and identity is formed.  My sculpture aims to create such an environment, i.e. a space that encourages viewer participation and compels the viewer to become actively engaged with the sculpture in the context of a broader field of relations.<p></p>

                    In the 21st Century our understanding of environment has fundamentally changed with the prominence of such technologies as the Internet and mobile technology and social media.  We have a new understanding of geography and distance. Existing ideas of which, have been fundamental to art practise within Australia where distances within and from the ‘centres’ have often defined our understanding of self. We now have an understanding of space that is virtual as well as physical. The challenge is to represent this duality of ‘real’ and ‘imagined’ space. What does it mean to inhabit the physical world with a virtual dimension? Perhaps it calls for a reaffirmation of our rootedness to physical space.<p></p>

                    My current practise has begun to investigate the way in which we inhabit a space both internally and externally. My sculpture invites the viewer to explore these ideas about space in both a physical and imaginative way by creating spaces that they can envision themselves physically inhabiting, while also restricting that access and only allowing the viewer to imaginatively inhabit the space.  The correspondence between the real and the imagined, the connectedness of the inner and outer self has its foundations in the philosophy of the French existentialist, Maurice Mearleau-Ponty and the notion of embodiment; ‘being in the world’.  We are bodies and our lived experience of the body ensures that there can be no detachment of subject/object. Part of my objective in making an environment is to make the viewer more aware of the space that contains the sculpture and how it changes the sense of place. I also aim to provoke in the viewers an awareness of how their own body occupies a space.<p></p>

                    My sculpture is evolving through the articulation of three-core language groups: landscape, architecture and the membrane. The first two use the languages that are derived from Landscape and Architecture, the languages of environment. The sculptures directly reference the external world and the experience of existing within the world. In this regard there is a re-connection with the ideas of Merleau-Ponty. Corresponding to Merleau-Ponty’s philosophy of embodiment, the environments significance exists in how the objects are perceived through consciousness and continue to reveal themselves anew as the viewer moves through time and space. The sculpture refuses a purely logical unpacking they engender a physical response. The sculptures are bodies - disembodied – they speak of us but are not us.<p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    The third language developing in my sculpture is the membrane. The membrane serves as a metaphor for the body. The more work I do with skin the more important it has become to the work and the more meaning is endowed. It has become a surrogate body, a tactile representation of how we relate to our environment. The membrane is a catalyst towards containment; the entity that sits between physical spaces inside and outside. It is our internal and external self and functions as a barrier restricting access, dividing the space, creating separation but paradoxically the membrane also forms a conduit, a bridge between space; metaphysical or otherwise.<p></p>
